With regards to our learning processes, AI has contributed a significant amount in the sense that it helped clarify many obscure questions we had and also gave a general overview of topics we needed to understand for the project. Essentially, it helped create a starting point for us to learn more about these topics. When we were stuck on creating a solution for our problems, AI played a significant role in the problem solving process and although many times it was not perfect when it comes creating solutions, we took inspiration and important details from the provided solutions to fit our scenarios. Furthermore, when we encountered errors in our code, AI was instrumental in resolving these errors. When errors, such as a "NullPointerException," arose, AI helped explain these errors and also identified potential sources of these errors. As mentioned before, it created a starting point for us to build off of.
